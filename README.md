# Problem Description:
The task at hand is to create a relational database for a football club's operations. The central entity in the model is the Team entity, representing the football club itself. The club's operations include player, match, Tickets, and more. We aim to accurately model these relationships, generate sample data, and populate the entities and their attributes with this sample data. Furthermore, we are interested in performing functional queries on this data to gain valuable insights into the club's activities and operations.
# Data Model 
Our data model is structured around the framework of a fictional football club. The central entity in our model is the 'Team' entity, which represents the football club itself. Inside the club, we have various components, including 'Player,' 'Employee,' 'Match,' 'Sponsor,' 'Ticket,' 'Merchandise,' 'Orders,' 'Injury,' 'Payments,' 'Stadium,' and 'Results,' each with its own set of attributes.

We establish relationships between these entities to manage the club's operations effectively. For example, there is a one-to-many relationship between 'Team' and 'Player' to account for the numerous players associated with the club.

Similarly, the 'Coach' and 'Match' entities have their attributes and relationships. The 'Team' entity helps categorize different teams. 'Fan' represents the club's fan base, while 'Sponsor' keeps track of organizations or businesses supporting the club.

'Merchandise' includes details of the club's products, and 'Orders' handles financial transactions like revenue from ticket sales. 'Injury' tracks player injuries, and 'Employee' represents those responsible for evaluating new talent and coaching the team. The 'Stadium' entity provides information about the club's home stadium, and 'Ticket' manages ticketing for matches.

Incorporating these entities and relationships, our data model comprehensively captures the diverse aspects of the football club's operations, allowing for efficient management and analysis, tracking departments, employees, and services for smooth operation. <br>
